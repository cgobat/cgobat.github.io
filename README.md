# [cgobat.github.io](https://cgobat.github.io/)
Personal Github Pages site.
This website started by using the [academicpages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) (and was originally a fork), but has since been rebuilt several times. This branch contains a custom-built version created in Bootstrap Studio from the ground up. The website as it currently stands is deployed out of the [plain-academic](../../tree/plain-academic) branch.
