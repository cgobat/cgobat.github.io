# [cgobat.github.io](https://cgobat.github.io/)
Personal Github Pages site.
Originally I was using the [academicpages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) (hence why this repo is a fork), but the current version of this site uses the [Plain-Academic](https://github.com/mavroudisv/plain-academic) template.
