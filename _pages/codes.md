Listed here are some less monumental pieces of code that I still find worth sharing for one reason or another.

Spherical Harmonics visualization
------
I am currently working to analyze radio pulsar data in regards to the phenomenon of _nulling_, which is when pulsars skip pulse emission for one or many periods at a time. The code, which is still in active development, is at [cgobat/pulsar-nulling](https://github.com/cgobat/pulsar-nulling).

GW Course Map
------
This is a fitting engine started for a class project that uses SDSS data to infer stars' distance from Earth. Code can be found at [cgobat/stellar-spectra](https://github.com/cgobat/stellar-spectra). Details of methodology and functionality can be found in [this report](https://github.com/cgobat/stellar-spectra/blob/master/Spectral_Analysis_Report.pdf). An example of a spectrum fitted using this pipeline can be seen in the output of cell [6] in [`Magnitude spectrum analysis.ipynb`](https://github.com/cgobat/stellar-spectra/blob/master/Magnitude%20spectrum%20analysis.ipynb).

Monte-Carlo demonstration to approximate pi
------
This was a data viz project that generates a visually appealing Hertzsprung-Russel diagram, a foundational visualization tool of modern astronomy that plots stars' temperatures or spectral classes against their luminosities. All of the source code for the plotting and [report](https://github.com/cgobat/hr-diagram/blob/master/LaTeX%20report/H_R_report.pdf) typesetting can be found in [cgobat/hr-diagram](https://github.com/cgobat/hr-diagram). This is the final result: ![H-R.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cgobat/hr-diagram/master/LaTeX%20report/figures/diagram.png)
