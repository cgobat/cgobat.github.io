Listed here are some less monumental pieces of code that are still worth sharing for one reason or another.

## [Spherical Harmonics visualization](https://gist.github.com/cgobat/a13bb5fa5b854de586e43d841350a34b)
Function that takes the _l_ and _m_ (as well as a scaling coefficient) of one or multiple Laplace spherical harmonics and plots the superposition of one over the other.

## [GW Course Map](https://github.com/cgobat/gw-course-map)
Maps prerequisite dependencies as well as courses that satisfy multiple general education requirements to enable the most efficient completion of requirements for courses offered at GWU.

## [Monte-Carlo demonstration to approximate π](https://gist.github.com/cgobat/6cf66e89463be64142dd7b7366d34730)
Quick, naïve implementation of a pseudo-"Monte-Carlo" method to estimate the value of pi based on the probability of random chosen points falling inside its area.
