I am an undergraduate student at the George Washington University (Washinton, DC) majoring in Astronomy & Astrophysics with a double minor in Mathematics and Mind-Brain Studies. My experience includes research in multiple science/engineering laboratories at the University of Washington (Seattle, WA), data analysis work, and positions in IT and astronomy equipment retail. My interests lie in image acquisition and analysis, simulation, and data visualization in general.

This site serves as a personal landing page, mostly to exhibit my projects and code samples.
